    "### What is retrieval-augmented generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the responses generated by large language models (LLMs) by augmenting them with additional data sources. When given a query or prompt, the LLM consults these additional data sources for relevant information. The information it retrieves from these sources is used to augment that input, which is then given to the LLM. The LLM then generates a response based on both the original query and the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results produced are often more accurate and up-to-date, since it’s based on inforamtion beyond the model’s own training data, and the additional information often contains fewer “hallucinations” or false information. Because the source of the additional information is known, using RAG sometimes has the added benefit of producing results that are more transparent and explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Writer Knowledge Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Writer Knowledge Graph is a form of RAG based on a graph database, which uses a graph structure to represent and store data. Unlike a traditional relational database where data is stored in tables, a graph database is built on nodes, which represent entities, and edges, which connect the nodes and represent the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph acts as a repository of information that you can fill by adding files to it. When you add a file to a knowledge graph, the graph processes the file, adding it to its graph database and incorporating its information. You can create multiple knowledge graphs, and each knowledge graph can have multiple files, allowing you to create knowledge graphs for specific topics, domains, or areas of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs and files are managed using two different APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Knowledge Graph API allows you to manage knowledge graphs. You can get a list of the knowledge graphs currently in your account, as well as create, retrieve, update, and delete them. You can also add any file that you have uploaded to your Writer account to any of your knowledge graphs, and you can add the same file to more than one knowledge graph.\n",
    "2. The file api allows you to manage files, which live in their own repository. You can get a list of the files currently in your account, as well as create, retrieve, update, and delete them. You can also download the contents of any file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can upload these file types to Writer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `csv`\n",
    "- `doc` and `docx`\n",
    "- `eml`\n",
    "- `html`\n",
    "- `pdf`\n",
    "- `ppt` and `pptx`\n",
    "- `srt`\n",
    "- `txt`\n",
    "- `xls` and `xlsx`"

    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below performs the initialization required for this notebook including the creation of an instance of the `Writer` object to interact with the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Palmyra client object, you need an API key. [You can sign up for one for free](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have an API key, we recommend that you store it as an environment variable in a `.env` file like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "WRITER_API_KEY=\"{Your Writer API key goes here}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you instantiate the client with `client = Writer()`, the newly-created object will automatically look for an environment variable named `WRITER_API_KEY` and will complete the instantiation if an only if `WRITER_API_KEY` has been defined. This notebook uses the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library to automatically define environment variables based on the contents of an `.env` file in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Writer()` initializer method also has an `api_key` parameter that you can use like this...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "client = Writer(api_key=\"{Your Writer API key goes here}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...but we strongly encourage you not to leave API keys in your source code."
