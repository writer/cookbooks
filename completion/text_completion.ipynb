    "\n",
    "**_Text completions_** are LLM responses to a user’s request, command or question. They tend to be longer than chat completions, and you can specify a maximum response length. This cookbook shows how to use the `create()` method of Writer’s `completions` object to create apps that provide text completions, with streaming and non-streaming responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "**In text completion, the model generates or completes text based on a given prompt.** It’s usually a single-turn process, where the user provides an input and the model generates an output, and the model doesn’t have to maintain context or history over multiple inputs and outputs. It’s “one and done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Text completion, as its name implies, is often used for completing sentences and paragraphs, but can also be used to generate long-form text content based on a single prompt or some kind of partial input. You may want to think of text completions as longer-form versions of “one-shot” chat completions."

This notebook uses the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library to automatically define environment variables based on the contents of an `.env` file in the same directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "This version of the app calls the `create()` method in pretty much the same way with one notable exception: the argument it provides for the `stream` parameter is `True`, which specifies that Palmyra should stream its responses as it generates them rather than waiting until the response has been completely generated before returning it:\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why does this version use Jupyter Widgets?\n",

    "The `for` loop continues as long as the stream hasn’t finished, with each iteration happening when Palmyra generates the next part of its response. The problem is that if you use the `print()` function to display the chunks as they arrive, you get output that looks like this:\n",

    "#### Drawing the UI\n",
