    "# **Chat completions with Writer**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Chat completions_** are LLM responses to the user in a conversation or chat. They tend to be shorter than text completions, but are often part of a sequence of exchanges between the user and the model. This cookbook shows how to use the `chat()` method of Writer’s `chat` object to build apps for single-turn and multi-turn chats, with streaming and non-streaming responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What are chat completions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In chat completion, the model interacts with the user in a conversational format, _completing_ a chat by responding to them.** While a chat system can be used to get a single response to a single input, chat completion systems are designed to participate in a back-and-forth conversation with the user, which requires it to retain the history of a conversation and derive context from that history to generate useful and meaningful responses as the conversation continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat completion, as its name implies, is meant as a way to complete a conversation by providing the user with a human-like conversation partner. The term _completion_ is also used to mean the answer that a model provides in response to a user prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general categories of chat completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **“Single-turn” completions,** where the model is given a single prompt and generates a response or solution in a single step, without any follow-up. You may want to think of “single-turn” chat completions as shorter-form versions of text completions.\n",
    "2. **“Multi-turn” completions,** where the model and user have a back-and-forth conversation with multiple exchanges. In this kind of completion, the model appears to maintain a “sense of context” because it “remembers” what took place earlier in the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these categories, there are two options for the way the completion is returned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-streaming:** The model does not return a completion until it has been completely generated. There is a waiting period (typically a few seconds) while the completion is being generated.\n",
    "2. **Streaming:** The model returns the completion in chunks as it’s being generated. You need to write additional code to collect and assemble these chunks, but there’s almost no waiting period."

    "#### Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs with conversational interfaces like chat completions keep track of conversations using a list of messages categorized by roles. With Palmyra, there are three roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`user`**: This role is for messages containing user input or prompts, which Palmyra responds to. From the user’s point of view, `user` messages drive the conversation. An example of a `user` message is “What’s the fastest land animal?”\n",
    "2. **`assistant`**: This role is for messages containing Palmyra’s responses to the user’s input. Palmyra is playing the role of AI assistant. An example of an `assistant` message is “The fastest land animal is the cheetah. It can reach speeds up to 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h) in short bursts.”\n",
    "3. **`system`**: This role is for messages that function as additional instructions or that define how the assistant should behave during the conversation. A `system` message guides the behavior or personality of the assistant, specifying how Palmyra should respond, and is typically set at the start of a conversation. An example of a `system` message is “You are a knowledgeable assistant that provides concise answers to technical questions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling the `chat()` method\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Drawing the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "The `display_ui()` function creates four UI objects, or widgets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `prompt_text_box`: A text box where the user enters their prompt.\n",
    "- `temperature_slider`: A slider that lets the user can set the temperature within a range of 0.0 to 2.0 in increments of 0.1.\n",
    "- `submit_button`: The user clicks this button to submit their prompt.\n",
    "- `completion_text_area`: Palymra’s response appears here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widgets are laid out inside a `VBox` layout container.\n",
    "\n",
    "`display_ui()` also returns `prompt_text_box`, `temperature_slider`, `submit_button`, and `completion_text_area` widgets so that they can be referenced by other code."
