    "# Using Multimodal Chat with Palmyra X5\n",
    "\n",
    "The Palmyra X5 model supports multimodal chat, letting you [send both](https://dev.writer.com/home/chat-with-images) text and images in the same message. You can include local images (via data URLs) or images hosted online. This enables rich, visual conversations directly in chat completions.\n",
