    "# **Writer models**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the [_Models_](https://dev.writer.com/home/models) page on the Writer site lists Writer’s different large language models, the way to get the most up-to-date list of models is to do it _programmatically_. This cookbook will show you how.\n",

    "\n",
    "Writer produces different LLMs for different purposes, which are indicated by their names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **X (`x`)** models are general-purpose LLMs. They’re designed to work with all kinds of text and generate responses in all kinds of domains.\n",
    "- The **Medical (`med`)** models are tailored for the healthcare industry. They’re designed to understand and analyze medical documents, process clinical notes and answer medical questions, and generate diagnostic reports.\n",
    "- The **Financial (`fin`)** models are developed specifically for the financial sector. They’re designed specifically for analyzing and synthesizing long financial documents, including comprehensive market reports, detailed investment analyses, and lengthy regulatory filings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Writer model names include a number followed by “K.” This indicates the size of that model’s context window, expressed as thousands of tokens. For example, a number of models have “32K” in their name; these models have a 32,000-token context window."

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "WRITER_API_KEY=\"{Your Writer API key goes here}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you instantiate the client with `client = Writer()`, the newly-created object will automatically look for an environment variable named `WRITER_API_KEY` and will complete the instantiation if an only if `WRITER_API_KEY` has been defined. This notebook uses the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library to automatically define environment variables based on the contents of an `.env` file in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Writer()` initializer method also has an `api_key` parameter that you can use like this...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "client = Writer(api_key=\"{Your Writer API key goes here}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
