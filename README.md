## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pip (Python package installer)
- A Writer API key ([signup for free](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel), then follow [this Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart))

## Installation

Feel free to simply copy and paste the code snippets in the notebooks. If you prefer to run the cookbooks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/writer/cookbooks.git
   cd cookbooks
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv my_env
   source my_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `my_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Once you have an API key, we recommend that you store it as an environment variable in a `.env` file like so:

   ```
   WRITER_API_KEY="{Your Writer API key goes here}"
   ```

## Running the cookbooks

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Navigate to the notebook you want to run and open it.

4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the cells and interact with the AI SDK.
   
5. When youâ€™re done using the notebooks, deactivate the virtual environment:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```
