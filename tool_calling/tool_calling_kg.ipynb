    "# Using Knowledge Graph as a tool\n",
    "\n",
    "[Knowledge Graph](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/knowledge-graph) is Writer's graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). With the Knowledge Graph tool, you can access a Knowledge Graph in a chat with a Palmyra LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook shows how to use the Knowledge Graph tool to answer specific questions during a chat with an AI assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)\n",
    "- A Knowledge Graph. If you don't already have one, you can create one by following the [Knowledge Graph Cookbook](https://github.com/writer/cookbooks/blob/main/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph.ipynb) or the [Knowledge Graph tutorial](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/knowledge-graph).\n",
    "    - You'll need the ID of the Knowledge Graph you want to use as a tool. You can find the ID via the [API](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/api-reference/kg-api/list-graphs) or via the [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/knowledge-graph) UI. The ID is the last part of the URL for the Knowledge Graph: `https://app.writer.com/aistudio/organization/<organization_id>/knowledge-graph?graphId=<graph_id>`\n",
