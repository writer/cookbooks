    "# Using Writer's MCP package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to connect AI agents to Writer's ecosystem of tools using the [**Writer MCP (Model Context Protocol) SDK**](https://dev.writer.com/home/mcp-server) package. After completing this guide, you can chain together multi-step workflows without hardcoding API calls.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/register) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and [LangChain](https://dev.writer.com/home/integrations/langchain)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Writer SDK MCP package globally using npm. This provides the MCP server that enables interaction with Writer's AI tools and services.\n"
