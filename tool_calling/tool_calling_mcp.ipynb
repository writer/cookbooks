    "# MCP tool calling with the WRITER Node SDK\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Below are some of the core tools exposed by the WRITER MCP environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|----------|\n",
    "| `file_read` | Read the contents of a file (local or from resources). |\n",
    "| `upload_files` | Upload file bytes or text content to the WRITER platform. |\n",
    "| `create_graphs` | Create a new knowledge graph instance. |\n",
    "| `add_file_to_graph_graphs` | Associate an uploaded file with an existing knowledge graph. |\n",
    "| `question_graphs` | Query or ask questions against data in a knowledge graph. |\n",
    "| *(Other tools)* | Such as `update_graphs`, `delete_file`, `generate_content_applications`, etc. |\n",
    "\n",
