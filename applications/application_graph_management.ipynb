    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/register) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)\n",
    "- A [no-code chat application](https://dev.writer.com/no-code/building-a-chat-app) deployed in Writer AI Studio\n",
    "    - Only chat applications support attached Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "    - If you don't have an application deployed, follow [this guide](https://dev.writer.com/no-code/building-a-chat-app) to build and deploy a chat application.\n",
    "    - Store the application ID for later use in this tutorial. You can find the application ID in the URL of the application in the Writer AI Studio UI. The URL structure is: `https://app.writer.com/aistudio/organization/<organization-id>/app/<app-id>`.\n",
    "- A [Knowledge Graph](https://dev.writer.com/knowledge-graphs/introduction)\n",
    "    - If you don't have an existing Knowledge Graph, you can follow the steps [in this cookbook](https://github.com/writer/cookbooks/blob/main/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph.ipynb)\n",
