    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)\n",
    "- A [no-code application deployed in Writer AI Studio](https://dev.writer.com/no-code/introduction)\n",
    "    - If you don't have an application deployed, follow [this guide](https://dev.writer.com/no-code/building-a-text-generation-app) to build and deploy a text generation application.\n",
    "    - Store the application ID for later use in this tutorial. You can find the application ID in the URL of the application in the Writer AI Studio UI. The URL structure is: `https://app.writer.com/aistudio/organization/<organization-id>/app/<app-id>`.\n",
