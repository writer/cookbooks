    "\n",
    "Before getting started, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/register) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts (How It Works)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Strands’ `Agent` class to create a self‑contained agent that interacts with a language model and optionally calls tools.\n",
    "- WRITER’s Palmyra models (e.g., `palmyra-x5`, `palmyra-creative`) can be plugged into Strands via the WriterModel integration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you’ve installed the Strands Agents SDK with WRITER support, you can initialize a Strands agent that uses a Palmyra model from WRITER’s suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you set it up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `WriterModel` from the Strands integration and specify a model ID (for example, `palmyra‑x5`, `palmyra‑creative`, `palmyra‑med`).\n",
    "2. Create a Strands `Agent`, passing the model plus any tools you want to enable (such as a calculator or HTTP request tool).\n",
    "3. Provide a system prompt to define what the agent should do (tone, role, output format).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Best practice:** Use a clear and specific system prompt to define your agent’s role and expected behavior. If you include tools, make it explicit when and how the agent should use them. For many use‑cases a single agent with one model is sufficient and keeps the architecture simple.\n"
