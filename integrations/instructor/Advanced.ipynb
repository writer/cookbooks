    "# Nested Models & Robust Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to work with **complex nested Pydantic models** and implement **robust error handling** using Instructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook shows how to:\n",
    "- Use [complex nested Pydantic models](https://python.useinstructor.com/getting-started/#working-with-complex-models) (enums, regex, conditional fields)\n",
    "- Apply [validation rules and automatic retry/repair patterns](https://python.useinstructor.com/getting-started/#validation-and-error-handling)\n",
    "- Perform [streaming extraction](https://python.useinstructor.com/getting-started/#streaming-responses) (async generator style)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before getting started, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/register) account\n",
    "- An API key, which you can obtain by following the [API Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/home/quickstart)\n",
