    "# Using LangChain Middleware with ChatWriter\n",
    "[Middleware](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/overview) is a powerful feature in LangChain that lets you **control and customize the behavior of a ChatWriter agent at every step** of its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to apply both **built-in and custom middleware** to an agent. You'll explore features such as PII detection, call limits, human-in-the-loop workflows, prompt transformation, and more. By following this guide, you'll learn how to **monitor agent behavior, modify tool usage, and integrate advanced logic** into your agent workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before getting started, you'll need:\n",
    "- A Python environment with **LangChain** installed\n",
    "- Access to a **ChatWriter-compatible model**\n",
    "- Any tools you plan to integrate with your agent\n",

When agents fail in real-world use, it is often because the context was wrong, incomplete, or poorly formatted.\n",
